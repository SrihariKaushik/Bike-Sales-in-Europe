# Bike-Sales-in-Europe
Project Workflow:
Data Cleaning in MS Excel: The dataset is cleaned in MS Excel, addressing any missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data entries for accuracy and consistency.

Data Analysis and Interactive Dashboard: An interactive dashboard is created in Excel, showcasing insights into bike purchasing behavior based on income levels, family status, education, region, and commute distance. The dashboard allows users to filter and analyze how different factors, such as income or number of children, impact the likelihood of bike purchases.

This project provides valuable insights for companies and stakeholders in the bike industry, helping them tailor marketing strategies and improve sales targeting in various European markets.
